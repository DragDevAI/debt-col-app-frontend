# Owed Money Go Where?
This project aims to simulate an e-commerce service that users may select certain debt-collection services. Please note that this project is strictly for educational purpose only.

## Design Process
The application is targeted to peopl who got into problem with debtor who refuses to pay. The user can explore various services that we have to offer: setting up banners, painting messages or sending collector to the debtors' premises.

We aim big, the intention is to create a leading regional Ah-Long service.

## Features
The site locates user by checking their IP address (no cheating please!), from which we generate a "base" from where users travel.

Key input by users include the destination of their preference, from which content will be retrieved from various APIs and fed to users.

In the future the app may recommend users to book air-ticket and/or hotel, partnering with service providers in between the base and the destination.

## Technologies Used
We are minion coders who have just started, so basic HTML, CCS and JavaScript together with API are used in this app. We use Tailwind, Node JS, Express, JWT, bcrypt etc.

The API was developed with JWT authentication and authorisation for three different level of users: "admin", "user" and "guest.

## Testing
We did try our best.

### Content
The content was drafted by ~~me~~my evil twin brother.

Characters for collector are from One Piece, the copyright belongs to producer.
